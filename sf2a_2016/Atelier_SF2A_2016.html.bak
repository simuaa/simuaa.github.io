      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rationale</span>:<br>
      <br>
      The importance of numerical simulations in astrophysics has increased
      significantly over the past few years. Their aims are diverse, ranging
      from pure theoretical studies that includes more and more physics
      (dynamics, chemistry, radiative transfer) to detailed comparisons with the
      observations, their preparation or with the design and conception of space
      and ground based instruments.<br>
      <br>
      Such a massive change is, of course, not limited to astrophysics, but is
      widespread accross all fields of fundamental research. It results largely
      from the spectacular increase of the gigantic computing power of
      modern&nbsp; supercomputers that are now available to researchers both at
      the national (through GENCI) and european level (trough PRACE). It is
      accompanied by profound evolutions of the methods used by specialists of
      numerical simulations. More and more research projects are now performed
      in close collaborations with software engineers. With exascale computers
      coming soon, such a professionalism of high performance computing (HPC) is
      expected to become more and more unavoidable. Like the other communities
      in France, astrophysicists must prepare to that transition.<br>
      <br>
      In this context, we organize a workshop during the french astronomy week
      that will gather experts in HPC in order to present the current state of
      the art of french numerical simulations in astrophysics. By bringing
      together an audience with varied scientific interest, the goal of the
      workshop is to generate discussions about current technical problem and
      numerical methods as well as discuss their future evolutions.<br>
      <br>
      It will be organized over two afternoons (thursday 16 June and friday 17
      June) and will alternate between invited presentations that will
      illustrate spectacular results obtained by french research groups using
      massive numerical simulations and/or significant numerical development and
      a dozen of contributed talks. The invited speakers are:<br>

        <li>Nicolas Aunai (LPP)</li>
        <li>Sacha Brun (CEA/Saclay)</li>

        <li>Philippe Grand-Clement (LUTH, Obs. Meudon)</li>
        <li>Pierre Ocivrck (Obs. Strasbourg)</li>
        <li>Francois Rincon (IRAP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #333333;">Registration
